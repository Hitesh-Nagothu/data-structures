# Project Notes

This repo will be a collection of some data structures implemented using modern c++. 

## 1. Base standards

 - No use of code generation tools or Intellisense in VSCode
 - Add unit tests for each implementation
 - Reference to leetcode questions (may not necessarily use the implemented data structures to solve a question, but the concept remains)
 - Personal notes that will be written on the go
